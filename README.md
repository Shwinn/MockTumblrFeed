# Project 1 - MockTumblrFeed

MockTumblrFeed is an app that uses the Tumblr API to create a feed filled with pictures from Humans of New York.

Time spent: 1.5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of recent pictures from the Humans of New York page.
- [x] Pictures are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Autosizing the UIImageView to the size of the picture given by the API.
2. How to make the app such that when an image is clicked on the story for that picture is displayed.
